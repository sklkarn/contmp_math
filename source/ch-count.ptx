  <title>Principle of Counting</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      <em>Counting</em> is a fundamental concept in Mathematics. In ancient times, people 
      used fingers, beans, sticks, buttons, and beads for counting. Later it was realised that 
      these methods of counting cannot be used in the cases where very large quantities of numbers were involved. 
      </p>
    <p> The (fundamental) counting principle gives an idea of <em>how to figure out the number of possible outcomes for 
      a given situation.</em> The counting principle has two rules: The <term>addition rule</term> 
      and the <term>multiplication rule</term>.
    </p>
   <p>
    In doing any task, if the task is distributed into two or more parts and each part is compulsory to complete the task, then we use <em>principle of 
    multiplication</em> to find the number of ways we can finish the task. However, if the each part is not compulsory 
    but optional to complete the task then we use <em>principle of addition</em> to find the number of ways we can finish the task. For example: 
    Suppose a person want to go from <term>city A</term> to <term>city C</term> via <term>city B</term> as shown in the figure below. 
    There are <m>m</m> ways to go from <term>city A</term> to <term>city B</term> and <m>n</m> ways to go from <term>city B</term> 
    to <term>city C</term>, then total number of ways he can go from <term>city A</term> to <term>city C</term> is given 
    by <m>m\times n.</m> Here, the person cannot reach to <term>city C</term> without going to <term>city B.</term> 
    So the each part of work is compulsory to him. Hence, we use the principle of multiplication.

       \node {City A}
          child {node {City B}
          child {node {City C}   
          }
                     };
      \end{tikzpicture}
    </latex-image>
      </image>

      <p>
        Now suppose a person has to go from <term>city A</term> to <term>city C</term>. But he has two choices to reach to <term>city C</term>. 
        He can go either  via <term>city B</term> or via <term>city D</term> as shown in figure below. There are <m>m</m> ways (roads) to go from 
    <term>city A</term> to <term>city C</term> via <term>city B</term> and <m>n</m> ways to go from <term>city A</term> to <term>city C</term> 
    via <term>city D</term>, then total number of ways he can go from <term>city A</term> to <term>city C</term> is given by <m>m + n.</m> 
    Here, the person can reach to <term>city C</term> from <term>city A</term> either by going through <term>city B</term> <em>or</em> 
    by going through <term>city D</term>. So the each part of work is not compulsory to him. Hence, we use the principle of addition.
