  <title>Classification of Numbers</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p> 
        A number is a mathematical value used for counting, measuring, or labelling objects. 
       In our daily life, we use these numbers to perform all the mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, 
       multiplication, and division. 
    </p>
 <p>
  The counting number systems are given as 
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
       <term> Natural Numbers:</term> 
       <me>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,\ldots, \infty</me> 
       Natural numbers starts from 1 which is the first number to begin counting and continue endlessly. Each number in natural 
       number can be obtained by adding 1 to the previous number. It may contain 10, 20, 100, etc. but not mare <em>zero</em>. 
       Natural numbers are all positive numbers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Whole Numbers:</term> 
        <me>0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,\ldots, \infty</me>. Whole numbers also contain zero, (<m>0</m>) and every numbers in natural numbers.  
          Whole numbers are also all positive.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Integers:</term> 
        <me> -\infty, \ldots -5,-4,-3,-2, -1, 0, +1,+2,+3,+4,+5,\ldots, \infty</me>. Integers are the Whole numbers with both 
        positive and negative numbers.  Hence, we have positive inegers as <m>0, +1,+2,+3,+4,+5,\ldots \infty </m> and 
        negative integers as <m>-1,-2,-3, \ldots, -\infty </m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Prime Numbers:</term> The natural numbers which has two factors or divisible by only itself and by a <m>1</m> is known as prime numbers.
        <me>
          2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, \ldots, \infty. 
        </me>
        Number <m>2</m> is only even number in prime numbers. <m>1</m> is not considered as a prime number because it can 
        be only divisible by itself and there is no other number which can divide <m>1</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Composite Numbers:</term>  The number which has at least three divisors is known as composite number. 
        Example: 4 can be divisible by 1, 2, and 4. Hence 4 is one of the composite numbers. 
        Similarly, <me>4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, \ldots </me> are composite numbers.
           </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Rational Numbers:</term> Rational numbers can be expressed as a fraction 
        in the form of <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are any integer but <m>q \neq 0</m>. Rational numbers are 
        positive, negative, and zero. 
         
        <me>  
          \frac{p}{q} =  \frac{5}{2},  -\frac{5}{1},  \frac{1}{2} =0.5,  -\frac{1}{3} =-0.33333, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{7}{8},
          \frac{8}{4}, \sqrt{9}, 0, \ldots.
        </me>
        Rational numbers can be converted to both terminating and non-terminating decimal numbers but with repeating value.
        Examples:
        <me>
          \frac{25}{4} = 6.25. \text{ (terminating value)}
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{1}{3} = 0.333 \ldots = 0.\dot{3} = 0.\bar{3}. \text{ (3 repeats forever)} 
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857 \ldots. \text{ (14285714 repeats forever)}
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{77}{600} = 0.128333 \ldots. \text{ (3 repeats forever)}
        </me>         
        To show a repeating digits in a decimal number, we put either a dot or a line above the repeating digit as shown above.     
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Note:</term> The sum of two rational numbers or the product of two rational numbers is also rational. Examples:
        <me>
          \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6} (\text{rational})
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} (\text{rational})
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Irrational Numbers:</term> The numbers which are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. 
        Irrational numbers could be written in decimals but not in the form of fractions, which means they cannot 
        be written as the ratio of two integers. Irrational numbers are non-terminating and non-repeating digits after decimal point. Examples: 
        <me>
          \sqrt{3} = 1.73205 \ldots.
        </me>
        <me>
          \sqrt{8} = 2.8284271 \ldots.
        </me>
        <me>
         \pi = 3.1415926 \ldots.
        </me>
        <m>\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{10}, 1.24387\ldots, \ldots </m> are irrational numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Note: </term> The sum of two irrational numbers or the product of two irrational numbers is not always irrational.
        Examples: 
        <me>
          \sqrt{2}+ \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} (\text{irrational})
        </me>
        <me>
          \sqrt{5} + (-\sqrt{5}) = 0 (\text{rational})
        </me>
        
        <me>
          \sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6} (\text{irrational})
        </me>
       <me>
        \sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{4} (\text{rational})
       </me>
       
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Rational numbers are finite and repeating decimals whereas irrational numbers are infinite and non-repeating.</em>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Real Numbers:</term> A real number is any rational or irrational number, 
        including positive and negative whole numbers, integers, decimals, fractions, and numbers such as pi <m>(\pi)</m> 
        and Euler's number <m>(e)</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Infinity <m>(\infty)</m> and negative infinity <m>(-\infty)</m> are not real numbers. 
        Because infinity and negative infinity can have different values. For example, the set of whole 
        numbers is infinite. So is the set of integers. But, the two sets are not of the same size.
      </p>
      <p>
       The four main properties of real numbers are the commutative property, associative property, 
        distributive property, and identity property. If <m>m, n,</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers, then:
      </p>
      <p>
        <term> Commutative Property: </term> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Addition:</em> <m>m + n = n + m.</m> For example: <m>5 + 23 = 23 + 5</m>.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>Multiplication:</em> <m>m \times n = n \times m</m>. For example: <m>5 \times 2 = 2 \times 5</m>.
         </p>
        <p>
          <term> Associative Property: </term> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Addition:</em> <m>m + (n+r) = (m+n) + r.</m> For example: <m>5 + (2+3) = (5+2) +3</m>.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>Multiplication:</em> <m> (mn) r = m(nr).</m> For example: <m>(5\times 2) \times 3 = 5 (2\times 3)</m>.
         </p>
         <p>
          <term> Distributive Property: </term> <m>m (n + r) = mn + mr </m> and <m>(m + n) r = mr + nr.</m>
          Example: <m>2(3 + 5) = 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 5 = 16.</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <term>Identity Property: </term> 
        </p>
          <p>
            <em>Addition:</em> <m>m + 0 = m.</m> <m>0</m> is an additive identity.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>Multiplication:</em> <m> m \times 1 = 1 \times m =m.</m> <m>1</m> is a multiplicative identity.
           </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Complex Numbers:</term> The complex number is the combination of a real number and an imaginary number. 
        The complex number is in the form of <m>a+ib</m>, where <m>a</m> = real number and <m>ib</m> = imaginary number. 
        Also, <m>a,b</m> belongs to real numbers and <m>i = \sqrt{-1}.</m> This numbers are very useful in analysing 
        phasor diagram in electricity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers which are not real are imaginary numbers. When we square an imaginary number, it gives a negative result. 
          It is represented as <m>Im()</m>. Example: <m>\sqrt{-2}, \sqrt{-7}, \sqrt{-11}</m> are all imaginary numbers. The roots of 
          equation <m>x^2+1 = 0</m> is an imaginary number.
        </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
 </p>

 <p>
  In addition to these numbers there are some famous numbers pairs such as <term>Amicable Numbers Pair</term> and <term>Co-prime Numbers pair.</term>
  <ol marker="i">
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Amicable Numbers: </term> Pairs of distinct natural numbers where each number 
        is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Steps to Find Amicable Pairs: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Identify Proper Divisors: For a given number <m>n</m>, identify all proper divisors 
              (divisors less than <m>n</m> that divide <m>n</m> without leaving a remainder).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Sum of Proper Divisors: Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Check for Amicability: For a number <m>A</m>, if the sum of its proper divisors is <m>B</m>, 
              and the sum of the proper divisors of <m>B</m> is <m>A</m>, then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> form an amicable pair.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      Example: Identify Proper Divisors: 
     </p>
     <p>
      Proper divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110

     <p>
      Check for Amicability: Since the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the

  <title>Prime Numbers</title>
  <p>
    If a number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself is falls under prime number. 
    Here is one basic step to identify prime numbers:
   </p>
   <p>
    <term>Basic Division Method Steps:</term> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Check Divisibility: Divide the number by all integers from 2 up to the square root of the number.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prime Confirmation: If none of these divisions result in a whole number, the number is prime.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: Check if 29 is prime.
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>\sqrt{29} \approx 5.39</m> (so check divisors up to 5)
  </p>
  <p>
    29 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, 29 is prime.
  </p>

      <ol marker ="i">
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 1: </em> all numbers are divisible by <m>1.</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 2: </em> numbers that have either even number or zero at the unit place are divisible by <m>2.</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 3: </em> A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 4: </em> divide the last two numbers (numbers at tenth and unit place) of the given number, 
            if it is divisible by <m>4</m> then the given number must be divisible by <m>4.</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 5: </em> numbers that contain either zero or <m>5</m> at the unit place must be divisible by <m>5.</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 6: </em> if the number divisible by both <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> then the number must be divisible by <m>6.</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 7: </em> double the number at the unit place and subtract it from the remaining numbers of the given number 
            (repeat the process if needed), if the result is 0 or a multiple of 7, then the original number is divisible by <m>7</m>.
            Example: Check if 203 is divisible by 7: 
          </p>
          <p>
            Step I: double the last number, <m>3 \times 2 = 6</m>
           </p>
           <p>
            Step II: subtract from rest of the given numbers,  <m>20-6 = 14</m>
           </p>
           <p>
            Step III: Since 14 is divisible by 7, 203 is also divisible by 7.
           </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 8: </em> divide the the last three numbers (hundreds, tenths, unit) by 8, if they are divisible 
            by 8 then the original number is also divisible by <m>8</m>.
              Example: Check if 4728 is divisible by 8: 
          </p>
          <p>
            Last three digits: 728, 
               </p>
               <p>
                Check divisibility: <m>728 \div 8 = 91</m> (no remainder), Since 728 is divisible by 8, hence, 4728 is also divisible by 8.
               </p>
          </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Divisible by 9: </em> A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
