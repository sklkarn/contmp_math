  <title>Classification of Numbers</title>


  
  <introduction>
    <p> 
        A number is a mathematical value used for counting, measuring, or labelling objects. 
       In our daily life, we use these numbers to perform all the mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, 
       multiplication, and division. 
    </p>
 <p>
  The counting number systems are given as 
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
       <term> Natural Numbers:</term> 
       <me>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,\ldots, \infty</me> 
       Natural numbers starts from 1 which is the first number to begin counting and continue endlessly. Each number in natural 
       number can be obtained by adding 1 to the previous number. It may contain 10, 20, 100, etc. but not mare <em>zero</em>. 
       Natural numbers are all positive numbers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Whole Numbers:</term> 
        <me>0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,\ldots, \infty</me>. Whole numbers also contain zero, (<m>0</m>) and every numbers in natural numbers.  
          Whole numbers are also all positive.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Integers:</term> 
        <me> -\infty, \ldots -5,-4,-3,-2, -1, 0, +1,+2,+3,+4,+5,\ldots, \infty</me>. Integers are the Whole numbers with both 
        positive and negative numbers.  Hence, we have positive inegers as <m>0, +1,+2,+3,+4,+5,\ldots \infty </m> and 
        negative integers as <m>-1,-2,-3, \ldots, -\infty </m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Prime Numbers:</term> The natural numbers which has two factors or divisible by only itself and by a <m>1</m> is known as prime numbers.
        <me>
          2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, \ldots, \infty. 
        </me>
        Number <m>2</m> is only even number in prime numbers. <m>1</m> is not considered as a prime number because it can 
        be only divisible by itself and there is no other number which can divide <m>1</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Composite Numbers:</term>  The number which has at least three divisors is known as composite number. 
        Example: 4 can be divisible by 1, 2, and 4. Hence 4 is one of the composite numbers. 
        Similarly, <me>4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, \ldots </me> are composite numbers.
           </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Rational Numbers:</term> Rational numbers can be expressed as a fraction 
        in the form of <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are any integer but <m>q \neq 0</m>. Rational numbers are 
        positive, negative, and zero. 
         
        <me>  
          \frac{p}{q} =  \frac{5}{2},  -\frac{5}{1},  \frac{1}{2} =0.5,  -\frac{1}{3} =-0.33333, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{7}{8},
          \frac{8}{4}, \sqrt{9}, 0, \ldots.
        </me>
        Rational numbers can be converted to both terminating and non-terminating decimal numbers but with repeating value.
        Examples:
        <me>
          \frac{25}{4} = 6.25. \text{ (terminating value)}
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{1}{3} = 0.333 \ldots = 0.\dot{3} = 0.\bar{3}. \text{ (3 repeats forever)} 
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857 \ldots. \text{ (14285714 repeats forever)}
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{77}{600} = 0.128333 \ldots. \text{ (3 repeats forever)}
        </me>         
        To show a repeating digits in a decimal number, we put either a dot or a line above the repeating digit as shown above.     
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Note:</term> The sum of two rational numbers or the product of two rational numbers is also rational. Examples:
        <me>
          \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6} (\text{rational})
        </me>
        <me>
          \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} (\text{rational})
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Irrational Numbers:</term> The numbers which are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. 
        Irrational numbers could be written in decimals but not in the form of fractions, which means they cannot 
        be written as the ratio of two integers. Irrational numbers are non-terminating and non-repeating digits after decimal point. Examples: 
        <me>
          \sqrt{3} = 1.73205 \ldots.
        </me>
        <me>
          \sqrt{8} = 2.8284271 \ldots.
        </me>
        <me>
         \pi = 3.1415926 \ldots.
        </me>
        <m>\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{10}, 1.24387\ldots, \ldots </m> are irrational numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Note: </term> The sum of two irrational numbers or the product of two irrational numbers is not always irrational.
        Examples: 
        <me>
          \sqrt{2}+ \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} (\text{irrational})
        </me>
        <me>
          \sqrt{5} + (-\sqrt{5}) = 0 (\text{rational})
        </me>
        
        <me>
          \sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6} (\text{irrational})
        </me>
       <me>
        \sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{4} (\text{rational})
       </me>
       
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Rational numbers are finite and repeating decimals whereas irrational numbers are infinite and non-repeating.</em>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Real Numbers:</term> A real number is any rational or irrational number, 
        including positive and negative whole numbers, integers, decimals, fractions, and numbers such as pi <m>(\pi)</m> 
        and Euler's number <m>(e)</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Infinity <m>(\infty)</m> and negative infinity <m>(-\infty)</m> are not real numbers. 
        Because infinity and negative infinity can have different values. For example, the set of whole 
        numbers is infinite. So is the set of integers. But, the two sets are not of the same size.
      </p>
      <p>
       The four main properties of real numbers are the commutative property, associative property, 
        distributive property, and identity property. If <m>m, n,</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers, then:
      </p>
      <p>
        <term> Commutative Property: </term> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Addition:</em> <m>m + n = n + m.</m> For example: <m>5 + 23 = 23 + 5</m>.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>Multiplication:</em> <m>m \times n = n \times m</m>. For example: <m>5 \times 2 = 2 \times 5</m>.
         </p>
        <p>
          <term> Associative Property: </term> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Addition:</em> <m>m + (n+r) = (m+n) + r.</m> For example: <m>5 + (2+3) = (5+2) +3</m>.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>Multiplication:</em> <m> (mn) r = m(nr).</m> For example: <m>(5\times 2) \times 3 = 5 (2\times 3)</m>.
         </p>
         <p>
          <term> Distributive Property: </term> <m>m (n + r) = mn + mr </m> and <m>(m + n) r = mr + nr.</m>
          Example: <m>2(3 + 5) = 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 5 = 16.</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <term>Identity Property: </term> 
        </p>
          <p>
            <em>Addition:</em> <m>m + 0 = m.</m> <m>0</m> is an additive identity.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>Multiplication:</em> <m> m \times 1 = 1 \times m =m.</m> <m>1</m> is a multiplicative identity.
           </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term> Complex Numbers:</term> The complex number is the combination of a real number and an imaginary number. 
        The complex number is in the form of <m>a+ib</m>, where <m>a</m> = real number and <m>ib</m> = imaginary number. 
        Also, <m>a,b</m> belongs to real numbers and <m>i = \sqrt{-1}.</m> This numbers are very useful in analysing 
        phasor diagram in electricity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers which are not real are imaginary numbers. When we square an imaginary number, it gives a negative result. 
          It is represented as <m>Im()</m>. Example: <m>\sqrt{-2}, \sqrt{-7}, \sqrt{-11}</m> are all imaginary numbers. The roots of 
          equation <m>x^2+1 = 0</m> is an imaginary number.
        </p>
