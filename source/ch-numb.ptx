  <title>Number Systems</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    A number system is used to express the numbers. It is the mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set 
      by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. There are four types of number system:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Binary: It has base of <m>2</m> and consists two digits family of <m>(0,1)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Decimal: It has base of <m>10</m> and consists ten digits family of <m>(0,1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Octal: It has base of <m>8</m> and consists eight digits family of <m>(0,1, 2,3,4,5,6,7)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Hexadecimal: It has base of <m>16</m> and consists sixteen digits and symbols family of <m>(0,1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, A, B,C,D,E,F)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      It provides a unique representation of every number. It also allows us to operate mathematical operations 
      like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

  Here we are going to discuss only decimsal number system. All the other number systems are mostly used in electronic world.
