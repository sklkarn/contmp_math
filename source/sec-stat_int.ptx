  <title>Data Analysis</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    <term>Data:</term> Facts or pieces of information that can be measured. 
    Data can be collected from investigations, observations, experiements, etc. Data are organized in two basic types 
    <ol marker ="i">
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Qualitative or Categorical Data:</term> It describes the features such as color, gender, code, birth date, 
          address, blood group, etc. It cannot be used to perform any mathematical operations.
          <ol marker ="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                Nominal Data: It helps to label the variables without providing the numerical value. 
                Nominal data are letters, symbols, words, gender, numbers, cloth's size, etc. 
                These data are grouped into categories, and then the frequency or the percentage of the data can be calculated. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Ordinal Data: The order of data is presented here. In orderinal data, order is important but not their values. 
                The information may be expressed using tables in which each row in the table shows the distinct category.

          <term>Quantitative or Numerical Data:</term> Numerical data gives information about the quantities of a specific thing. 
          e.g., height, length, size, weight, and so on. It can be used for mathematical operations.

                Discrete Data: It can take only discrete values. Discrete information contains only a finite number of possible values. 
                e.g., number of bank account, number of children, number of students in the class.

                Continuous Data: It has an infinite number of probable values that can be selected within a given specific range. 
                For example, height <m> = 60.4, 70.0, 50.15</m> inches; weight <m>= 45, 70.3, 65.6, 101.7</m> pounds, etc. 
                </p>
              <p>
                Continuous data can also be classified as <term>Interval</term> and <term>Ratio</term> data. 
                Interval scales can represent values below zero. Ratio variables never fall below zero. e.g., 
                A certain temperature can fall below 0 degrees (interval data). 
                Your height and weight cannot equal zero or be below zero (Ratio data).

  <title>Population and Sample</title>
  <p>
    Sample is a small subset of a larger set of data used to draw inferences about the larger set. 
    The larger set is known as the population from which the sample is drawn. 
  </p>
  <p>
   <term> Population</term> is a complete set of all items that interest an investigator. Population size, <m>N</m> can be very large to even infinity. 
     A <term>Sample</term> is an observed subset of the population of size <m>n.</m>

    <p>
      Mention the types of data being used in the above data table and give the name of missing variables.
    </p>
 
<p>
  <term>Variable:</term> A variable is a property that can take many values. It is used in singular mode, meaning it takes only one value. e.g. 
  <em>age</em> = 12, 24, 48, 60, 100 years; <em>weight</em> = 172, 172.5, 180 cms; <em>height</em> etc. are variable. But, 
  <term>ages:</term> [12, 24, 48, 60, 200] taken in plural mode is not a variable.
