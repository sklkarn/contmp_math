  <title>The Addition Principle</title>

 
  <p>
    The <term>Addition Rule</term> of counting is used to calculate the total number of possible 
    outcomes when there are distinct multiple events or choices, and the events are not overlapping (mutually exclusive). 
   <em> Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur simultaneously</em>. For example: If you toss coin you 
   either get <term>Head</term> or <term>Tail</term>. There is no way you get head and tail together. Hence, tossing a 
   coin is mutually exclusive event. when rolling a standard six-sided die, getting a 1 <term>OR</term> getting a 2 
   are mutually exclusive events (they cannot be taken together). If you draw a card from a standard card deck, 
   you may get <term>Ace</term> of <term>Heart</term>. Hence, this is a non-mutually exclusive event 
   or we can call it is a simultaneous event that two things can happen together.
       </p>
       <p>
        The addition rule can employ to determine the total number of ways of something can happen if we have to make one 
    choice <alert>OR</alert> another choice <alert>OR</alert> another choice, and so on.  
       </p>
       <p>
        The addition rule can be expressed as:
        Total Outcomes = Number of Outcomes in Event A + Number of Outcomes in Event B + <m>\ldots</m> + Number of Outcomes in Event N.
        In this formula, Event A, Event B, and so on, represent the different mutually exclusive events under consideration.  
       </p>
      
            <p>
        The Addition Rule of Counting can also be extended to more complex situations where events are not 
        mutually exclusive. This principle allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes when events may overlap. 
        The <term>Inclusion-Exclusion Principle</term> can be used to find possible outcomes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Total Outcomes = Number of Outcomes in Event A + Number of Outcomes in Event B + <m>\ldots</m>
        - Number of Outcomes in (Event A <m>\cap</m> Event B) - <m>\ldots</m>
        </p>
        <p>
        In this formula, the subtraction of overlapping outcomes (Event A <m>\cap</m> Event B) corrects for the double 
        counting of outcomes that belong to both events. This principle is particularly useful in situations 
        where events can occur together, such as when calculating the probability of two events happening simultaneously.
        </p>
        

        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
              In a class there are 15 boys and 12 girls. The teacher wants to select either a boy or a girl to represent the class for a function.
              In how many ways can the teacher make the selection?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Select 1 boy <alert>OR</alert> 1 girl. Selecting a boy and a girl is not compulsory. Any one of them do the task complete. 
              Hence, use principle of addition.
              <m>\therefore \text{ total ways } = 15 + 12 = 27 </m> ways.
            </p>
          </solution>
