    <statement>
      <p>
        Jessica has a jar of cookies. It has 3 chocolate and 3 peanut cookies in it. 
        Jessica only wants to eat one cookie. How many possible options does Jessica have?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Since Jessica only wants one cookie, she has to choose only one cookie from 3 chocolate or 3 peanut cookies. 
        The choices are mutually exclusives, so by applying the rule of sum, we have <m>3+3 =6</m> possible options.

        In a standard deck of playing cards, you have four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades), 
        and each suit has 13 ranks (Ace through King). How many ways can you draw a card that is either a Heart or a King? 
         </p>
          </statement>
         <solution>
          <p>
             Using the Addition Rule: 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     Total Ways = Number of Ways to Draw a Heart + Number of Ways to Draw a King. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Total Ways = 13 (hearts) + 4 (Kings). 
                          </p>
                         <p>
                          Total Ways = 17 ways. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    There are 17 ways to draw a card that is either a heart or a King from a standard deck.

    <solution>
      <p>
        Total Combinations = Number of Action Movies + Number of Comedy Movies + Number of Science Fiction Movies. 
             </p>
             <p>
              Total Combinations = 4 + 3 + 2. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Total Combinations = 9 different combinations.

                            Choice C: Dessert (2 options). 
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                        You want to create a one-course meal by selecting one option from each category (appetizer, main course, dessert). 
                                        How many different meal combinations can you create?
                                      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Total Meal Combinations = Number of Appetizer Options + Number of Main Course Options + Number of Dessert Options. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Total Meal Combinations = 3 (appetizers) + 5 (main courses) + 2 (desserts). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Total Meal Combinations = 10 different meal combinations. 
              </p>
              <p>
                So, there are 10 different meal combinations you can create by applying the Addition Rule.
