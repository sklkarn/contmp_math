  <title>Probability</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event to occur. 
      Many events cannot be predicted with total certainty. 
      Probability can help predict the chance of an event to occur i.e., it is a measure of how likely the events are going to happen. 
      Probability can range from 0 to 1, where 0 means the event to be an impossible one and 1 indicates a certain event. 
      The probability of all the events in a sample space adds up to 1.

      <p>
        For example, a fair coin is tossed, we can get either a Head OR a Tail. So, only two possible outcomes 
        are possible <m>(H, T)</m>. But when two coins are tossed then there will be four possible outcomes, 
        i.e <m>\{(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)\}</m>.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Random Experiment:</alert>  An experiment whose outcome is known.
            e.g., tossing a coin, throwing a dice, drawing a card, etc.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Sample Space:</alert>  Set of all possible outcomes.
           e.g., sample space of throwing a dice, 
           <me> S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6 \}</me>. 
           Here, 1, 2, 3,... etc. are sample points (or, sample outcomes); sample space of tossing a coin, 
           <me>S = \{H,T \}</me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
           <alert> Event:</alert> Subset of sample space. Getting an odd number in a dice. 
            e.g. <m>E = \{1,3,5\}</m>
           </p>

                <p>
                  <alert>Null Event: </alert> It has no outcome, or no element in it. For example suppose a sample space 
                  <me>
                    S = \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6\}
                  </me>
                  Now, an event, A = number greater than 6.
                  <me>
                    A = \phi

                  <me>
                    \therefore P(A) =0.

                  It is also called impossible or void event.

              an event, B = Even prime number.
