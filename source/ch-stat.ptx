  Descriptive stat. tells about the questions like:  
  What is the average marks of students in the class?  What percentage of students are passing the class?
  Descriptive statistics include graphical and numerial procedure that are used to summarize data and to 
  transform data into information.  Examples: The number of customers who visited a jeweelery shop in the last 10 days were 
  <m>83, 80, 79, 84, 85, 106, 110, 120, 74, 77.</m> By looking to the data one can see there is not much variation in the first 5 days, 
  high sale in next two days (Weekend?), high again in the next day (specific occasion?).

 Inferential stat. tells about the questions like: Are the markes of the students of this class room similar to the markes of other 
 math classes in the school. Here we are comparing the data set of one class room to the other many math class rooms. Inferential statistics 
 provides bases for forcast, predictioins, and estimations that are used to transform information into knowledge. 
 Estimating parameter: average age of customers, test a hypothesis, forcast for rain tomorrow.
