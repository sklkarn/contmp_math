  <title>Subset</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    If all elements of set <m>A</m> are present in set <m>B</m>, then set <m>A</m> is called a subset of set <m>B</m>.
    It is denoted by <m>A \subseteq B</m>. In other words, 
    <em> Set <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m> if every elements of <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B </m></em> 
    even if the set <m>B</m> has same elements as set <m>A</m> has.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: If <me>A = \{3, 5, 7\},</me> and 
    <me>B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</me> then 
    <me>
      A \subseteq B
    </me>
    <notation><usage><m>A \subseteq B</m></usage><description><m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m></description></notation>
    <me>\{4,5,8\} \subseteq \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \}</me>
  </p>
<p>
  <term>Note:</term> Subset <m>A</m> has less number of elements or equal to the set <m>B</m>. For example: If 
  <me>X  =\{2,5,7\}</me> 
  and 
  <me>
  Y  =\{2,3,5,7\}
  </me>
    then 
  <me>
    X \subseteq Y
  </me>
  or 
  <me>
    X \subset Y
  </me>
  Also, if 
   <me>X  =\{2,5,7\}</me> 
  and 
  <me>
  Y  =\{2,5,7\}
  </me>
   then 
  <me>
    X \subseteq Y
  </me>
</p>
 <p>
  If <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m> then <m>A \subseteq B,</m> and <m>A=B.</m>
 </p>
 

<p>
  <term>Proper subset:</term>
  Proper subset has less elements than the set. For example: If 
   <me>X  =\{2,5,7\}</me> 
  and 
  <me>
  Y  =\{2,3,5,7\}
  </me>
   then 
  <me>
    X \subset Y
  </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>A</m> is a <term>proper subset</term> of <m>B</m> then <m>A \subset B,</m> and <m>A \neq B.</m>

  <title>Superset</title>
  <p>
    When set <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m>, then set <m>B</m> is called the superset of <m>A.</m> Symbolically,
    <m>B \supseteq A</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: <m>A = \{vowels\},</m> <m>B = \{alphabet\}</m>, then <m>A \subseteq B,</m> and <m>B \supseteq A,</m> but <m>B \not \subset A.</m>
  </p>
  <p>
   <term> Superset:</term> If Set <m>B</m> has more elements or equal to set <m>A</m> then we can say 
   <me>
    B \supseteq A
   </me>
   
    <me>
    \{4, 14, 24\} \supseteq \{4, 14, 24\}
   </me>
   or, 
   <me>
    \{4, 14, 24, 34, 44\} \supseteq \{4, 14, 24\}
   </me>

   <term> Proper Superset:</term> If Set <m>B</m> has more elements than set <m>A</m> then we can say 
   <me>
    B \supset A
   </me>
  For example:   
   <me>
    \{4, 14, 24, 34, 44\} \supset \{4, 14\}
   </me>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-power_set">
  <title>Power Set and Cardinal Number</title>
    <p>
    The collection of all subsets of a set <m>A</m> is called the power set of <m>A.</m> It is denoted by <m>P(A).</m>
    In <m>P(A)</m>, every element is a set. i.e., 
    <me>
      P(A) = \{s : s \subseteq A\}.
    </me>
    Since, the empty set and the set <m>A</m> itself are subsets of <m>A</m> therefore the elements of 
    <m>P(A).</m> Thus, the power set of a given set is always non-empty. 
       The possible number of subsets of any set is called a power set. 
     </p>
  <p>
    Example: If <m>A = \{1, 2, 3\},</m> then 
    <me>
      P(A) = \{\phi, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\} \}.
    </me>
    </p>

  <p>
    The  <em>number of subsets</em> of a set with <m>n</m> number of elements is given by <m>|P(A)| = 2^n, </m> 
    where <m>n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots </m> is a cardinal number of the set.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the  <em>number of proper subsets</em> of a set with <m>n</m> number of elements is given by <m>|P(A)| = 2^n-1, </m> 
    where <m>n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots </m> is a cardinal number of that power set.
  </p>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-universal">
  <title>Universal Set</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>
    A set that contains all the elements of the related sets is called an universal set. It is denoted by <m> \bigcup </m>.
    The set <m>A = \{March, April\} </m> is a subset of universal set <m>\bigcup =\{ \text{ Months of a year} \} </m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <term>Note:</term> 
    If Universal set contains Sets A, B and C, then these sets are also called subsets of Universal set. Denoted by:
      <m> A \subset U </m>, <m>B \subset U </m>, and <m> C \subset U </m>.
    </p>
<p>
  Example: Let the sets <m>A=\{1,3,6,8\}, </m> <m>B=\{2,3,4,5\}</m> and <m>  C=\{5,8,9\}</m>, then their Universal set is defined as 
    
    <me>
      \bigcup = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9\}.

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-intervals">
  <title>Intervals, for <m>a, b \in \mathbb R</m></title>
  <p>
    In mathematics, an interval can be defined as a set of real numbers 
    that contains all real numbers lying within any two specific numbers of the set <m>\mathbb R</m>. 
    <term>Interval Notation</term> uses inequalities to represent a subset of real numbers by those numbers 
    that bound them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider an interval signified as <m>0 \lt x \leq 5</m>, which means a set of numbers 
        lying between 0 and 5 (excluding 0 but including 5) represent the value of x.
      </p>
      <p>
       <term> Types of Interval Notation:</term> There are different types of notations of intervals 
       that are classified based on the endpoints of intervals. They are: Open intervals, Closed intervals, 
       Half-open intervals, Degenerate intervals, and Bounded and Unbounded intervals.

  <title>Disjoint Sets: </title>

    Two sets are said to be disjoint if they do not have any common element. 
   If <m>A=\{1, 2, 3\}</m> and <m>B = \{4, 5, 6\}</m> are two disjoint sets, then <m>A \cap B = \phi </m>.
   The empty set is disjoint with itself. i.e., <m>\phi \cap \phi = \phi.</m>

    <p>
      There is a difference between the intersection of two sets and the difference of two sets. 
   In the case of disjoint, only intersection will be considered.

    <term>Difference between Joint and Disjoint Sets:</term>
    If <m> X = \{1, 5, 7\}</m> and <m>Y = \{3, 5, 6\}</m>, then
