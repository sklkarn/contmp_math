  <title>Permutation and Combination</title>


  <introduction>

    <p> <alert>Permutations</alert> 
      A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a definite order. In other words, permutaions are 
      different arrangements of a given numbers of things by taking some or all at a time. 
      For example: Let's say we have three coins, a dime, D, a nickel, N, and a quarter, Q. 
      In how many ways can you arrange these coins?
       </p>
       <p>
        Here are the possible arrangements of <m>D, N, Q</m>: 
        <md>
          <mrow> i. \quad \amp = DNQ</mrow>
          <mrow> ii. \quad \amp = DQN</mrow>
          <mrow> iii. \quad \amp = NDQ</mrow>
          <mrow> iv. \quad \amp = NQD</mrow>
          <mrow> v. \quad \amp = QDN</mrow>
          <mrow> vi. \quad \amp = QND</mrow>
        </md>
        So there are <m>6</m> different arrangements (or permutations).
       </p>
<p>
  Find the permutations of the letters <m>A, B, C</m> by taking two at a time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are the arrangements 
  <md>
    <mrow> i. \quad \amp = AB</mrow>
    <mrow> ii. \quad \amp = BC</mrow>
    <mrow> iii. \quad \amp = CA</mrow>
    <mrow> iv. \quad \amp = AC</mrow>
    <mrow> v. \quad \amp = CB</mrow>
    <mrow> vi. \quad \amp = BA</mrow>
  </md>
  so <m>6</m> permutations. 
 </p>
 <p>
  <alert>Remember:</alert> order (place) is very important in permutations.
 </p>


 
 <p> <alert>Combinations</alert> 
  A combination is a selection of objects in any order. The combination means <em>Selection of things</em>, 
  where the order of things has no importance. In other words, combinations are 
  selection of a given numbers of things by taking some or all at a time without giving importance of their order (place). 
  For example: Let's say we have three letters <m>A, B, C</m>.  In how many ways can you 
  select (choose) these letters by taking two at a time.
  </p>
<p>
Here are the selection without any order
<md>
<mrow> i. \quad \amp = AB</mrow>
<mrow> ii. \quad \amp = BC</mrow>
<mrow> iii. \quad \amp = CA</mrow>
</md>
so <m>3</m> combinations. 
</p>
<p>
<alert>Remember:</alert> order (place) is not important in combination. In combination <m>AB </m> is same as <m>BA</m> or <m>AC =CA</m>.
</p>
<p>
  All combinations of letters <m>A,B, C,D</m> taken two at a time: 
  <me>
    AB \quad AC \quad AD \quad BC \quad BD \quad CD
  </me>
  i.e., 6 total selections.
</p>
<p>
  All combinations of letters <m>A,B, C,D</m> taken three at a time: 
  <me>
    ABC \quad BCD \quad ABD \quad CDA
  </me>
  i.e., 4 total selections.
