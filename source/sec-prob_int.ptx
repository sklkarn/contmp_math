  <introduction>
    <p>
      If a random experiment has total of <m>(m+n)</m> mutually exclusive, mutually exhaustive, and equally likely outcomes, out of which 
      there are <m>m</m> favorable events <m>E</m>, then the probability of occurrence of event <m>E</m> is denoted by <m>P(E).</m>
      <men xml:id="eqn-prob1">
        P(E)  = \frac{\text { favorable outcomes}}{ \text{ total outcomes}}
      </men>
      </p> 
<p>
  In sample space, <me>
    S = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n \}
  </me>
  each sample points are equally likely events, then we can find the probability of occurrence using <xref ref="eqn-prob1"/>. 
  However, if they are not equally likely then <xref ref="eqn-prob1"/> can not be used directly.
</p>
<p>
  <term>Note: </term> If all outcomes of sample space are not equally likely, then 
  <me>
    P(E) = \text { sum of probability of all the favorable outcomes of E.}
  </me>
  here, in sample space, 
   <me>
    S = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n \}
   </me>
   <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots </m> are not equally likely outcomes, 
   then <xref ref="eqn-prob1"/> cannot be applied.

      <term></term> It is the possibility of an event that 
      based on the existence of a previous event or outcome. In other words, 
      The probability of occurrence of any event A when another event B in relation to A has already occurred 
      is known as conditional probability. It is depicted by <m>P(A|B)</m>, here "|" read as <term>given</term>. 
     So <m>P(A|B)</m> reads as probability of A given B.

          Imagine a student is absent from school twice a week, excluding Sunday. 
          If it is known that he will be absent from school on Tuesday, 
          then what are the chances that he will also be absent on Friday in the same week? 
          It is observed that in problems where the occurrence of one event affects the 
          happening of the following event, these cases of probability are known as conditional probability.
