      Let's say you are selecting a three course dinner meal at your cafeteria.

      Assume you want to eat a salad, an entrée and a desert, how many different meals are possible?

        Harry went to a food restaurant, and he wants to order a combo deal that includes a pizza, 
        drink, and dessert. The following choices are available: Pizza: Chicken Fajita, and Vegetable. 
        Drink: Pepsi and 7-Up.
        Dessert: Ice-cream and Pie.
      </p>
    </statement>

      <p>
        As the tree diagram shows, we can work out the possible arrangements for a combo deal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Deal 1: Chicken fajita, Pepsi, and Ice-cream. 
             </p>
             <p>
              Deal 2: Chicken fajita, Pepsi, and Pie.

                      Deal 4: Chicken fajita, 7-UP, and Pie.

                         <p>
                          Deal 5: Vegetable Pizza, Pepsi, and Ice-cream. 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Deal 6: Vegetable Pizza, Pepsi, and Pie.

                                    <p>
        Now solving it by counting principle, we have 2 options for pizza, 2 for drinks and 2 for desserts so, 
        the total number of possible combo deals = <m>2 \times 2 \times 2 =8</m>.

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        There are three types of shirts, two types of pants and three types of shoes. 
        While the tie is optional, the tie has two options, either “Yes” or “No.” 
            </p>
            <p>

        How many numbers are there between 100 and 1000 in which all the digits are distinct?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        For the distinct digits 9 8 7 is a maximum number and 1 0 2 is minimum a number. Hence, in the boxes of 3 digit number. 
        <m>9</m> comes at the hundreds place (zero does not take this position as the number becomes less than 100), 
        <m>9</m> comes at the tens place (as total 10 numbers <em>from 0, 1, 2, --- 9</em> with number 1 less 
        due to hundreds place digit), and <m>8</m> at the units place.
        <me>
          \therefore 9 \times 9 \times 8 = 648.

        How many 9-digit numbers of different digits can be formed?

    <solution>
      <p>
        Out of 10 digits from 0, 1, 2 ---9, we can place any 9 digit at <m>9^{th}</m> place, because 0 at the <m>9^{th}</m> 
          place makes the number 8-digit only. Hence, 
        <me> 
          9 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 3265920.

        when the repetition of digits is not allowed?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The <m>4^{th}</m> place only takes number 2, the places takes any numbers with no repetition.

     <p>
      The numbers formed here are all three digits between 107 to 997. So we place 7 at unit place (only one choice),
      any other numbers can be placed at the tens place (10 choices from 0,1,2,3,---9), and the hundreds place take 
      any numbers except <m>0</m> (9 choices) because repetition allowed.

  <solution>
     <p>
      The numbers formed here are all three digits. In case one, place 7 at units place (only 1 choice), 
      tens place takes any numbers (10 choices), and hundreds place takes any numbers except <m>0</m> (9 choices).

         <p>
          In case two, place 7 at tens place (only 1 choice), units place takes any numbers (10 choices), and

      The numbers formed here are all three digits. In case one, place 7 at units place (only 1 choice),
