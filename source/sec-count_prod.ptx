  <title>The Multiplication Principle</title>

 
<p>
  The <term>Multiplication Rule</term> states that "if an event can occur in <m> m</m> different ways, 
  and another event can occur in <m>n</m> different ways, 
  then the total number of occurrences (possible outcomes) of the events is <m>m \times n</m>. 
  The answer of the following problem can be obtained by using <term>multiplication rule </term>. 
  Suppose you have 3 pairs of shoes and 4 pairs of socks, then how many ways you can wear them.
</p>


<p>
  The fundamental principle of counting only works when the choice that is to be made are independent of each other. 
  If one possibility depends on another, then a simple multiplication does not work.
</p>
<p>
  A boy has 4 shirts, 2 pairs of paints, and 3 hats. Find the total number of possible outfits he could have.
</p>
<p>
  A tree diagram is a useful tool for visualizing systematic counting.

<p>
  <term>Difference in addition and multiplication rule</term>: The Addition Rule is used when you want to calculate the 
  total number of outcomes when events are mutually exclusive, and you want to consider the possibilities for each event 
  separately and then add them together. The Multiplication Rule, on the other hand, is used when you have multiple events 
  or choices that are independent (the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the others, i.e., not mutually exclusive or simultaneous), 
  and you want to calculate the combined possibilities by multiplying them.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In a class there are 15 boys and 12 girls. The teacher wants to select 1 boy and 1 girl to represent the class for a function.
        In how many ways can the teacher make the selection?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Select 1 boy <alert>AND</alert> 1 girl. Selecting a boy and a girl is compulsory. Hence, use principle of multiplication.
        <m>\therefore \text{ total ways } = 15 \times 12 = 180 </m> ways.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
