  <title>Types of Sets</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          <alert>Null or Empty or Void set:</alert> A set which does not contain any element is called a null set. 
          It is denoted by <m>\phi</m> or <m>\{ \}</m>. It is like an empty bag.       
            <m>\{ \{ \} \}</m> is a set containing an empty set.
         </p>
            <p>
              Let <m>A</m> be a set of natural number less than 1, then <m>A</m> is an empty set. i.e. <me>A =\{ \}.</me>
            </p>
            </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Finite Set: </alert> A set which is either empty or has finite number of elements is called a finite set. 
            For example: <m>A = \{ 1,2,3\}</m> or <m>B= \{ \} </m> or <m>B = \emptyset </m>. In set <m>A</m> there are 4 elements. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Set of days of week.
          </p>
          <p>
            <remark>
              Number of elements in a finite set is called the order or the cardinality of the set. 
              It is denoted by <m>n(A) </m> or, <m> o(A)</m>.
              For examples: <ol marker ="a">
                <li>
                  <m>A = \{1, 2, 3 \}</m> has n(A) = 3.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <m>B = \{1, 2, \phi, \{3\} \}</m> has n(B) = 4.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <m>C = \{ \{1, 2\}, 3 \}</m> has n(C) = 2.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </remark>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Infinite Set: </term> A set having infinite number of elements is called an infinite set. 
            The elements of infinite set cannot be counted.
          </p>
          <p>
            A set of squares of natural numbers is an infinite set, bacause natural numbers are infinite. 
            <m>\{ 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots \}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Equal Sets: </term> The sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are said to be identical or equal if they have exactly the same elements. 
            In other words, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equal if every element of <m>A</m> is an element of <m>B</m> 
            and conversely every element of <m>B</m> is also an element of <m>A.</m> Equal sets are denoted as <me>A = b</me>. 
            If the sets are not equal we write them as <me>A \neq B</me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples: 
            <me>A =\{ monkey, dog, cat\}</me>
            <me>
              B =\{ cat, dog, monkey\}
            </me>
          Here <m>A = B.</m>
            <m>
              X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4\}
            </m>
            and 
            <m>
              Y = \{ 2, 2, 1, 3, 4 \}
            </m>
             are equal sets. Since <m>Y</m> has repeated element <m>2</m> and set contains only distinct elements.
          </p>
          <p>
          If  <m>X=\{ 0\} </m> and <m>Y=\{ \phi\}</m>, then <m>X \neq Y,</m> they are two different sets.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Equivalent Sets: </term> two finite sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equivalent, if their cardinal numbers are same.
            i.e., <m>n(A)=n(B)</m>. Equivalent sets are written as <m>A \sim B</m> or <m>A \leftrightarrow B.</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <m>A = \{\text{letter of FOLLOW} \}</m>  and </p>
            <p>
            <m>B = \{\text{letter of FLOW} \}</m> then <m>A = B </m>
            </p>
            <p>
because each set can be written as <m>\{ F, O, L, W\}.</m>   Also <m>n(A) = n(B)=4,</m> hence, <m>A \sim B.</m>
</p>
<p>
  <term>Remember:</term> 
  <ol marker ="i">
    <li>
      <p>
        Equal sets are always equivalent, but converse is not always true.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Two empty sets are always equal.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Two infinite sets are always equivalent.
