  "body": " Classification of Numbers   A number is a mathematical value used for counting, measuring, or labelling objects. In our daily life, we use these numbers to perform all the mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  The counting number systems are given as    Natural Numbers:  Natural numbers starts from 1 which is the first number to begin counting and continue endlessly. Each number in natural number can be obtained by adding 1 to the previous number. It may contain 10, 20, 100, etc. but not mare zero . Natural numbers are all positive numbers.     Whole Numbers:  . Whole numbers also contain zero, ( ) and every numbers in natural numbers. Whole numbers are also all positive.     Integers:  . Integers are the Whole numbers with both positive and negative numbers. Hence, we have positive inegers as and negative integers as .     Prime Numbers: The natural numbers which has two factors or divisible by only itself and by a is known as prime numbers. Number is only even number in prime numbers. is not considered as a prime number because it can be only divisible by itself and there is no other number which can divide .     Composite Numbers: The number which has at least three divisors is known as composite number. Example: 4 can be divisible by 1, 2, and 4. Hence 4 is one of the composite numbers. Similarly, are composite numbers.     Rational Numbers: Rational numbers can be expressed as a fraction in the form of where and are any integer but . Rational numbers are positive, negative, and zero. Rational numbers can be converted to both terminating and non-terminating decimal numbers but with repeating value. Examples:    To show a repeating digits in a decimal number, we put either a dot or a line above the repeating digit as shown above.   Note: The sum of two rational numbers or the product of two rational numbers is also rational. Examples:       Irrational Numbers: The numbers which are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. Irrational numbers could be written in decimals but not in the form of fractions, which means they cannot be written as the ratio of two integers. Irrational numbers are non-terminating and non-repeating digits after decimal point. Examples:    are irrational numbers.   Note: The sum of two irrational numbers or the product of two irrational numbers is not always irrational. Examples:       Rational numbers are finite and repeating decimals whereas irrational numbers are infinite and non-repeating.      Real Numbers: A real number is any rational or irrational number, including positive and negative whole numbers, integers, decimals, fractions, and numbers such as pi and Euler's number .  Infinity and negative infinity are not real numbers. Because infinity and negative infinity can have different values. For example, the set of whole numbers is infinite. So is the set of integers. But, the two sets are not of the same size.  The four main properties of real numbers are the commutative property, associative property, distributive property, and identity property. If and are real numbers, then:   Commutative Property:    Addition:  For example: .   Multiplication:  . For example: .   Associative Property:    Addition:  For example: .   Multiplication:  For example: .   Distributive Property:  and Example:    Identity Property:    Addition:   is an additive identity.   Multiplication:   is a multiplicative identity.     Complex Numbers: The complex number is the combination of a real number and an imaginary number. The complex number is in the form of , where = real number and = imaginary number. Also, belongs to real numbers and This numbers are very useful in analysing phasor diagram in electricity.  The numbers which are not real are imaginary numbers. When we square an imaginary number, it gives a negative result. It is represented as . Example: are all imaginary numbers. The roots of equation is an imaginary number.       Prime Numbers  If a number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself is falls under prime number. Here is one basic step to identify prime numbers:   Basic Division Method Steps:   Check Divisibility: Divide the number by all integers from 2 up to the square root of the number.  Prime Confirmation: If none of these divisions result in a whole number, the number is prime.  Example: Check if 29 is prime.   (so check divisors up to 5)  29 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, 29 is prime.    Divisibility rules      Divisible by 1: all numbers are divisible by      Divisible by 2: numbers that have either even number or zero at the unit place are divisible by      Divisible by 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.     Divisible by 4: divide the last two numbers (numbers at tenth and unit place) of the given number, if it is divisible by then the given number must be divisible by      Divisible by 5: numbers that contain either zero or at the unit place must be divisible by      Divisible by 6: if the number divisible by both and then the number must be divisible by      Divisible by 7: double the number at the unit place and subtract it from the remaining numbers of the given number (repeat the process if needed), if the result is 0 or a multiple of 7, then the original number is divisible by . Example: Check if 203 is divisible by 7:  Step I: double the last number,   Step II: subtract from rest of the given numbers,   Step III: Since 14 is divisible by 7, 203 is also divisible by 7.     Divisible by 8: divide the the last three numbers (hundreds, tenths, unit) by 8, if they are divisible by 8 then the original number is also divisible by . Example: Check if 4728 is divisible by 8:  Last three digits: 728,  Check divisibility: (no remainder), Since 728 is divisible by 8, hence, 4728 is also divisible by 8.     Divisible by 9: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.       Finding Divisors:     To find the divisors (or factors) of 220, you need to determine all the integers that divide 220 exactly (without leaving a remainder). Here's a step-by-step method:   Prime Factorization of 220:  (since 220 is even, divide by 2)  (since 55 ends in 5, divide by 5) (since 11 is a prime number, divide by 11) So, the prime factorization of 220 is:      Generate All Divisors: To find all divisors of 220, take every combination of the prime factors raised to their respective powers:  Start with the powers of 2: Then combine with the powers of 5: Finally, combine with the powers of 11:   The divisors are all the products of these combinations:        Famous prime Pairs  In addition to these numbers there are some famous numbers pairs such as Amicable Numbers Pair and Co-prime Numbers pair.     Amicable Numbers: Pairs of distinct natural numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.  Steps to Find Amicable Pairs:   Identify Proper Divisors: For a given number , identify all proper divisors (divisors less than that divide without leaving a remainder).    Sum of Proper Divisors: Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.    Check for Amicability: For a number , if the sum of its proper divisors is , and the sum of the proper divisors of is , then and form an amicable pair.     Example: Identify Proper Divisors, except itself:  Proper divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110  Proper divisors of 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142  Sum of Proper Divisors:  Sum of divisors of 220: 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110=284  Sum of divisors of 284: 1+2+4+71+142=220  Check for Amicability: Since the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, (220, 284) is an amicable pair.     Co-prime Numbers: pairs of numbers that have no common positive integer divisors other than 1. In other words, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.  Examples of Coprime Numbers:  8 and 15:  Divisors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8  Divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15  Common divisor: 1     Twin Prime Pairs: twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that their difference is exactly two. For example: If and are both prime numbers, then they are called the twin primes. Such as (3,5), (11,13), (17,19), etc.  Note: All twin primes are coprime pairs but all coprime pairs are not twin prime pair.      "

For example: If then Also, if then       Every set is a subset of itself, .    Null set is a subset of every set,      If and then        Proper subset Proper subset has less elements than the set. For example: If then     Superset  When set is a subset of , then set is called the superset of Symbolically, .  Example:  , then and but    Superset: If Set has more elements or equal to set then we can say  Proper Superset: If Set has more elements than set then we can say  or, But,     Power Set  The collection of all subsets of a set is called the power set of It is denoted by In , every element is a set. i.e., Since, the empty set and the set itself are subsets of and therefore elements of Thus, the power set of a given set is always non-empty.  Example: If then   The number of elements in power set is given by where is a cardinal number of the set.  or, the number of subset, where is a cardinal number of the set.    Universal Set   A set that contains all the elements of the related sets is called an universal set. It is denoted by . The set is a subset of universal set .   Note: If Universal set contains Sets A, B and C, then these sets are also called subsets of Universal set. Denoted by: , , and .  Example: Let the sets  and , then their Universal set is defined as     Intervals, for  In mathematics, an interval can be defined as a set of real numbers that contains all real numbers lying within any two specific numbers of the set . Interval Notation uses inequalities to represent a subset of real numbers by those numbers that bound them.  Consider an interval signified as , which means a set of numbers lying between 0 and 5 (excluding 0 but including 5) represent the value of x.   Types of Interval Notation: There are different types of notations of intervals that are classified based on the endpoints of intervals. They are: Open intervals, Closed intervals, Half-open intervals, Degenerate intervals, and Bounded and Unbounded intervals.      Open Interval: (a, b) or,         Closed Interval: [a, b] or,         Closed - open Interval:  including but excluding [a, b) or,         Open - closed Interval:  excluding but including (a, b] or,            Disjoint Sets:  Two sets are said to be disjoint if they do not have any common element. If and are two disjoint sets, then . There is a difference between the intersection of two sets and the difference of two sets. In the case of disjoint, only intersection will be considered. The empty set is disjoint with itself. i.e.,    Difference between Joint and Disjoint Sets: If and , then . Hence, X and Y are joint sets.  But, if and , then . Therefore, X and Y are disjoint sets.   "

  "title": "The Addition Principle",
  "body": " The Addition Principle  The Addition Rule of counting is used to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when there are distinct multiple events or choices, and the events are not overlapping (mutually exclusive). Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur simultaneously . For example: If you toss coin you either get Head or Tail . There is no way you get head and tail together. Hence, tossing a coin is mutually exclusive event. when rolling a standard six-sided die, getting a 1 OR getting a 2 are mutually exclusive events (they cannot be taken together). If you draw a card from a standard card deck, you may get Ace of Heart . Hence, this is a non-mutually exclusive event or we can call it is a simultaneous event that two things can happen together.  The addition rule can employ to determine the total number of ways of something can happen if we have to make one choice OR another choice OR another choice, and so on.  The addition rule can be expressed as: Total Outcomes = Number of Outcomes in Event A + Number of Outcomes in Event B + + Number of Outcomes in Event N. In this formula, Event A, Event B, and so on, represent the different mutually exclusive events under consideration.  The Addition Rule of Counting can also be extended to more complex situations where events are not mutually exclusive. This principle allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes when events may overlap. The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle can be used to find possible outcomes.  Total Outcomes = Number of Outcomes in Event A + Number of Outcomes in Event B + - Number of Outcomes in (Event A Event B) -   In this formula, the subtraction of overlapping outcomes (Event A Event B) corrects for the double counting of outcomes that belong to both events. This principle is particularly useful in situations where events can occur together, such as when calculating the probability of two events happening simultaneously.    In a class there are 15 boys and 12 girls. The teacher wants to select either a boy or a girl to represent the class for a function. In how many ways can the teacher make the selection?    Select 1 boy OR 1 girl. Selecting a boy and a girl is not compulsory. Any one of them do the task complete. Hence, use principle of addition. ways.    "

The answer of the following problem can be obtained by using multiplication rule . Suppose you have 3 pairs of shoes and 4 pairs of socks, then how many ways you can wear them.  The fundamental principle of counting only works when the choice that is to be made are independent of each other. If one possibility depends on another, then a simple multiplication does not work.  A boy has 4 shirts, 2 pairs of paints, and 3 hats. Find the total number of possible outfits he could have.  A tree diagram is a useful tool for visualizing systematic counting.      Difference in addition and multiplication rule : The Addition Rule is used when you want to calculate the total number of outcomes when events are mutually exclusive, and you want to consider the possibilities for each event separately and then add them together. The Multiplication Rule, on the other hand, is used when you have multiple events or choices that are independent (the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the others, i.e., not mutually exclusive or simultaneous), and you want to calculate the combined possibilities by multiplying them.    In a class there are 15 boys and 12 girls. The teacher wants to select 1 boy and 1 girl to represent the class for a function. In how many ways can the teacher make the selection?

Find the total number of ways of answering these questions, if the first 3 questions have 5 choices each and the next 3 questions have 4 choices each.    Make the 6 boxes and place their corresponding number of ways.       Four flags of different colors are given. How many different signals can be generated, if a signal requires the use two flags, one below another.    Make the 2 boxes and place their corresponding number of ways. Remember, the signal has to be generated with different colors.         Find the number of 4 letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word \"NOSE,\" when   The repetition of letters is not allowed.    The repetition of letters is allowed.       Make the 4 boxes and place their corresponding number of ways.                  How many words, with or without meaning of three distinct letters of the english alphabet are there.    Make the 3 boxes and place their corresponding number of ways.       Let's say you are selecting a three course dinner meal at your cafeteria. There are four different salads, three different entrees, and two different desserts to choose from. Assume you want to eat a salad, an entrée and a desert, how many different meals are possible?    The total number of meals is 24.      Harry went to a food restaurant, and he wants to order a combo deal that includes a pizza, drink, and dessert. The following choices are available: Pizza: Chicken Fajita, and Vegetable. Drink: Pepsi and 7-Up. Dessert: Ice-cream and Pie.    As the tree diagram shows, we can work out the possible arrangements for a combo deal.  Deal 1: Chicken fajita, Pepsi, and Ice-cream.  Deal 2: Chicken fajita, Pepsi, and Pie.  Deal 3: Chicken fajita, 7-UP, and Ice-cream.  Deal 4: Chicken fajita, 7-UP, and Pie.  Deal 5: Vegetable Pizza, Pepsi, and Ice-cream.  Deal 6: Vegetable Pizza, Pepsi, and Pie.  Deal 7: Vegetable Pizza, 7-UP and Ice-cream.  Deal 8: Vegetable Pizza, 7-UP and Pie.  Now solving it by counting principle, we have 2 options for pizza, 2 for drinks and 2 for desserts so, the total number of possible combo deals = .      Steve has to dress for a presentation. He has different shirts, different pants, and different shoes available in his closet. Wearing the Tie is optional. Calculate the total number of possible outfits.    There are three types of shirts, two types of pants and three types of shoes. While the tie is optional, the tie has two options, either “Yes” or “No.”  Total number of possible outfits = .      How many numbers are there between 100 and 1000 in which all the digits are distinct?    For the distinct digits 9 8 7 is a maximum number and 1 0 2 is minimum a number. Hence, in the boxes of 3 digit number. comes at the hundreds place (zero does not take this position as the number becomes less than 100), comes at the tens place (as total 10 numbers from 0, 1, 2, --- 9 with number 1 less due to hundreds place digit), and at the units place.       How many 9-digit numbers of different digits can be formed?    Out of 10 digits from 0, 1, 2 ---9, we can place any 9 digit at place, because 0 at the place makes the number 8-digit only. Hence,       How many numbers are there between and can be formed from the digits when the repetition of digits is not allowed?    The place only takes number 2, the places takes any numbers with no repetition.       How many 3-digit odd numbers can be formed by using the digits when   The repetition of digit is not allowed.    The repetition of digit is allowed           The unit place only takes 1, 3, and 5, the tens place takes any of the 5 digits.              How many odd numbers less than 1000 can be formed using the digits 0, 2, 5, 7. When the repetition of digits is allowed?       In one-digit number we have only two choices . In two-digit number we can place at units place and any other digits except at tens place.  In three digit numbers we can place only 5 and 7 at units place, any of the 4 digits can be placed at tens place, and any 3 digits except be placed at hundreds place.  Hence, the total odd numbers formed =       HOw many numbers are there between 100 and 1000 such that 7 is in the units place?    The numbers formed here are all three digits between 107 to 997. So we place 7 at unit place (only one choice), any other numbers can be placed at the tens place (10 choices from 0,1,2,3,---9), and the hundreds place take any numbers except (9 choices) because repetition allowed.       HOw many numbers are there between 100 and 1000 such that at least one of their digits is 7?    The numbers formed here are all three digits. In case one, place 7 at units place (only 1 choice), tens place takes any numbers (10 choices), and hundreds place takes any numbers except (9 choices).  In case two, place 7 at tens place (only 1 choice), units place takes any numbers (10 choices), and hundreds place takes any numbers except (9 choices).  In case three, place 7 at hundreds place (only 1 choice), units place takes any numbers (10 choices), and tens place takes any numbers (10 choices).     Hence the total numbers formed =       HOw many numbers are there between 100 and 1000 such that they have exactly one of their digits as 7?    The numbers formed here are all three digits. In case one, place 7 at units place (only 1 choice), tens place takes any numbers except (9 choices), and hundreds place takes any other numbers except (8 choices).  In case two, place 7 at tens place (only 1 choice), units place takes any numbers except (9 choices), and hundreds place takes any other numbers except (8 choices).  In case three, place 7 at hundreds place (only 1 choice), units place takes any numbers except (9 choices), and tens place takes any numbers except (9 choices).     Hence the total numbers formed =     "

In how many ways can they wear them?        each of these outfits are compulsory to complete dressed up for the men, hence multiplication principle is used here to find the total ways of wearing them.       How many different signals can be made by using any number of flags from flags of different colors?        Every signals are complete and independent on each other, hence addition principle is used to find the total numbers of signals.       A code is to consist of two distinct letters followed by two distinct numbers between 1 and 9. For example, CA35, DQ72, etc. are codes.   How many such codes are there?    How many of them end with an even integer?             We need distinct alphabets and digits to make codes. Hence the total codes are .  or, we have -     For even number on units place there are 4 choices and we need distinct numbers on each place so remaining 8-digits are only available for tens place. Hence,             Find the number of ways in which 5 boys and 3 girls can be arranged in a row so that no two girls come together.    To have no two girls together, we can arrange boys first and then place each girl between them or before or after the first and last boys.   B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 .   here 6 represents numbers of seats available for girls.      There are 2 english, 3 spanish, and 4 hebrew books. In how many ways can they be arranged on a self so as to keep all the books of the same language toghether?       Consider each language book as one bundle, so there are three bundles (objects). Hence, the number of ways we can arrange these bundles is given as Now, among each books in a bundle can be suffled together, hence, internal arrangements are given as Here, each tasks are compulsory to complete the work. Hence, the total number of ways to arrange the whole books are       In how many ways can 7 test papers be arranged so that the best and the worst papers are never come together?    P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7  Here, the total arrangements are for all papers together.     Now, number of ways in which the best and the worst papers come together is given by . First bundle of papers considered as 5 objects. and the second bundle is considered as 1 object, as they are coming together.  Hence, the number of ways when best and worst papers never come together is given by      Permutations of the repeating objects.     Find the number of permutations of            Find the number of permutations of            How many words can be formed using the letter thrice, the letter twice, and the letter thrice?    Total number of letters = . Hence, the total number of words can be formed =          Find how many arrangements can be made with the letters of the word     In how many of them are the vowels coming together?         In the letter  here, the letter is repeating 2 times, is repeating 2 times, and is repeating 2 times.    Make a bundle of all vowels and considere them as 1 object and all the remaining consonants are seperate 7 objects. Hence,               Find the number of arrangements of the letters of the word     In how many of these arrangements:   Do the words start with ?    Do all the vowels occur together?    Do the vowels never occur together?    Do the word begin with and end in ?                     Fix and then        Bundle all vowels together as 1 object and rest as 7 objects: and .       Vowels never come together = Total arrangements - vowels together.       Fix the position of at first place, , fix the position of at the end.               How many different words can be formed using all the letters of the word   In how many of them   Both do not come together?    The vowels occupy the even positions?             Put all into one box as 1 object and remaining others in another box as 7 objects.     Now, for both do not come together is given by     For the vowels occupy the even positions            first term for consonants and second term for vowels.         How many numbers greater than a million can be formed with the digits     1 million is a 7 digits number.         Total numbers formed here are given by as 2 is repeating twice and 3 is repeating thrice.  Any arrangement where takes the first position is less than a million. Hence, numbers less than a million are given as Therefore numbers greater than a million are given by       In how many ways can 4 letters be posted in 3 letter boxes?    Here repetition is allowed, so we can post all 4 letters into any of these 3 letter box. Hence the total number of ways is given by ways. Every letter has 3 choices.      In how many ways can 5 apples be distributed among 6 boys, if there is no restriction to the number of apples each boy may get?     every apple has 6 choices.      In how many ways can 3 prizes be distributed among 4 boys, when   No boys get more than 1 prize,    A boy may get any number of prizes,    No boy gets all the prizes?       Here, we have prizes: and boys:    First prize can be received by any one of the boys, so 4 choice, and 3 choice, and so on.          Boy gets all the prizes - all prizes go to any one of the boys.          How many four digit numbers can be formed using digits when a digit may be repeated any number of times in any arrangements?               "

  "body": " Statistics   Statistics is the science of collecting, arranging, and analyzing data for better decision making. It is of two types:    Descriptive Statistics: It consists of organizing and summarizing the data using quantitative methods.  Average salaries for various occupations in 2024.   Histogram, probability, permutation, combination, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, Gaussian distribution, log-normal distribution, binomial distribution, etc.     Measure of central tendency    Measure of dispersion        Inferential statistics: It is a technique taht we use to draw conclusions and make predictions.  z test, t-test, anova test, chi-square test, hypothesis testing, p-value, confidence inetrval.     Descriptive stat. tells about the questions like: What is the average marks of students in the class? What percentage of students are passing the class? Descriptive statistics include graphical and numerial procedure that are used to summarize data and to transform data into information. Examples: The number of customers who visited a jeweelery shop in the last 10 days were By looking to the data one can see there is not much variation in the first 5 days, high sale in next two days (Weekend?), high again in the next day (specific occasion?).  Inferential stat. tells about the questions like: Are the markes of the students of this class room similar to the markes of other math classes in the school. Here we are comparing the data set of one class room to the other many math class rooms. Inferential statistics provides bases for forcast, predictioins, and estimations that are used to transform information into knowledge. Estimating parameter: average age of customers, test a hypothesis, forcast for rain tomorrow.     Compare:    6'3\" boy to a 5'1\" boy.    GPA of 4.0 to GPA of 2.5    Income of $24,000 to income $15,000.    President to a professor.        Interpret or infer:    taller    more intelligent    wealth    power.            How do I price this car?    How much the customer is willing to pay?    What should be the capacity of the plant?        Why study Statistics: It helps in decision making or prediction in an uncertain environment. We collect and analyze data to make decision.     Data Analysis    Data: Facts or pieces of information that can be measured. Data can be collected from investigations, observations, experiements, etc. Data are organized in two basic types    Qualitative or Categorical Data: It describes the features such as color, gender, code, birth date, address, blood group, etc. It cannot be used to perform any mathematical operations.   Nominal Data: It helps to label the variables without providing the numerical value. Nominal data are letters, symbols, words, gender, numbers, cloth's size, etc. These data are grouped into categories, and then the frequency or the percentage of the data can be calculated.    Ordinal Data: The order of data is presented here. In orderinal data, order is important but not their values. The information may be expressed using tables in which each row in the table shows the distinct category.           Quantitative or Numerical Data: Numerical data gives information about the quantities of a specific thing. e.g., height, length, size, weight, and so on. It can be used for mathematical operations.   Discrete Data: It can take only discrete values. Discrete information contains only a finite number of possible values. e.g., number of bank account, number of children, number of students in the class.    Continuous Data: It has an infinite number of probable values that can be selected within a given specific range. For example, height inches; weight pounds, etc.  Continuous data can also be classified as Interval and Ratio data. Interval scales can represent values below zero. Ratio variables never fall below zero. e.g., A certain temperature can fall below 0 degrees (interval data). Your height and weight cannot equal zero or be below zero (Ratio data).          Population and Sample  Sample is a small subset of a larger set of data used to draw inferences about the larger set. The larger set is known as the population from which the sample is drawn.   Population is a complete set of all items that interest an investigator. Population size, can be very large to even infinity. A Sample is an observed subset of the population of size       Statistic: It is a specific characteristics of a sample. Parameter: It is a specific characteristics of the population. Population average, is a parameter. Sample average, is a statistic .   Simple Exercise: An airline claims that less than 6% of its flights from Lexington depart late. From a sample of 100 flight 6 flights were found to depart late.    What is the population?    What is the sample?    What is the statistic?    Is 6% a parameter or statistic?       Data Table   In data table Columns are called Variables and rows are called cases or Observations.   Mention the types of data being used in the above data table and give the name of missing variables.   Variable: A variable is a property that can take many values. It is used in singular mode, meaning it takes only one value. e.g. age = 12, 24, 48, 60, 100 years; weight = 172, 172.5, 180 cms; height etc. are variable. But, ages: [12, 24, 48, 60, 200] taken in plural mode is not a variable.   Variable Types:        Central Tendency   In statistics, understanding the data is very import to draw any information and conclusion. Central tendency and dispersion help us know the data distribution and their characteristics. Central tendency is the descriptive summary of a data set. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire data in the distribution. The central tendency of the dataset can be found using the three important measures namely mean, median and mode .  An average of the data can be the best measurement of central tendency. There are two ways to determine an average of the data:   Mathematical:   Arithmatic Mean (Mean)    Geometric Mean    Harmonic Mean       Positional:   Median    Mode          Mean (Arithmetic Mean)   There are three types of mean being used in mathematical operations: Arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean. Here we only discuss the arithmetic mean. There are three methods to determine the arithmetic mean.   Direct Method    Assume Mean Method, and    Step Deviation Method     Here we are trying to build an idea to find mean of the three different data (series):   Individual Series    Discrete Series, and    Continuous Series.       Raw Data (individual series):  The value of mean can be calculated as Here, is the observation of sample, and is number of observations.  The mean (also known as the average) is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values. It provides a balanced representation of the entire dataset. To acknowledge that we are calculating the population mean and not the sample mean, we use the Greek lower case letter \"mu\", denoted as : An important property of the mean is that it includes every value in your data set as part of the calculation. In addition, the mean is the only measure of central tendency where the sum of the deviations of each value from the mean is always zero.  The mean of    The mean of ungrouped data     The mean of ungrouped data       Discrete Series:  The mean can be calculated using the following methods:    Direct method:       Assumed mean method:  here, is assumed mean (middle mean value), is frequency of observation, and the deviation of observation,         Direct method to calculate Mean of grouped data:  Here is the caculation: Now,     Assumed mean method to calculate Mean of grouped data  Here is the caculation: To find the assumed mean, A we select the central observation (in case of two items at the middle, we need to select those observation which has high frequency). For the table above we select  Now,      If observations are not in order then first need to arrange the observation either in asscending or descending order as shown below:   First arrange in asscending order. Take , as observation 10 has higher frequency than 12. Now,     Continuous Series:  In continuous series, the observations are presented in different class intervals rather than by a single number and the frequency. It can be presented in two different types of class intervals: Exclusive series and Inclusive series. Continuous series includes the upper limit and the lower limit in the class interval. If the upper limit interval does not repeat itself as a lower limit of the next class interval then it is an inclusive series. There is a gap between upper limit of any class interval to the and lower limit of the next class interval. e.g., If the upper limit interval repeats itself as a lower limit of the next class interval then it is an exclusive series. There is no gap between the upper limit of any class interval to the and lower limit of the next class interval. e.g.,   The mean ( weighted mean of grouped data ) can be calculated using the following methods:   Direct method:  take average of each class range and the value in column.      Step deviation method: This method is only applicable for continuous series. here, , class interval. take .        Combined Mean       The mean weight of 15 students is 110 kg. The mean of 5 of them is 100 kg and another 5 kg of them is 125 kg, then the mean weight of remaining students is   120    105    115    none.        here       Mean Correction  Some time during mean calculation mistake happen, then we can use the following formula to correct it, without going through all the procedures.      The mean scores of 100 students were found to be 40. Later it was discovered that a score of 53 was missed as 83. Find the correct mean of corresponding correction.     using        Properties of mean  If origin or scale of data is changed then their mean is also changed by the same corresponding value. For example:    Change of origin: Suppose we have an individual series (raw data) It's mean = 3. (if the difference between every neighbours is same then, mean is the value at the middle term.)  If its origin is shifted (subtracted or added) by 10, then new  mean = 13, if 10 is added (new series ), or  mean = - 7, if 10 is subtracted (new series ).     Change of scale: For the same raw data, It's mean = 3.  If its scale is changed (multiplied or divided) by 10, then new  mean = 30, if 10 is multiplied into the data (new series ), or  mean = 0.3, if 10 is divided to the data (new series ).       If mean of , then find the mean of y, if           Other properties:   Mean is the best measure of central tendency, it is the most stable average of the data based on all the observations.    It is affected by the extreme values of the data.    it cannot be calculated for the open ended classification.        Median   Median, in statistics, is the middle value of the given list of data when arranged in an order. It is also called the positional average.    Raw Data (individual series)  The median of the following data can be found by rearranging them either in ascending or in descending order then select middle item.    after arranging it in increasing order Here, appeared at the middle term, so it is a median of the given data.     after arranging it in increasing order Here, and appeared as the middle terms, so it's median is average of these numbers.         Median for odd number of terms is given by here is number of terms in a series.    Median for even number of terms is given by here is number of terms in a series.       If median of is 10, then find the value of     Arrange the series in order, Now, take average of two middle terms from even number series.          Discrete Series (data)  Find the median of the following series   First arrange the observations in order  is cumulative frequency. Number of observation, = odd. Therefore, Hence, .          Median for even numbers observations Therefore,       Continuous Series    = Lower limit of median class, , upper CF, = frequency, class interval.     Exclusive class series:    Arrange the series in order , Hence, the median class.    from         Inclusive class series:    Convert the inclusive class series into exclusive series   median class selection = term. Hence, the median class. from        Properties of Median     Median is a Middle most values of ascending or descending order of the series.    It is a positional average    It is Not based on all the observation.    It is not affected by extreme fluctuations.    it is a best measure for open ended classification.        Mode   It is the most frequent value of the data.    Individual Series      mode = 10 (unimodal)     it has two most freuent data points, hence, the mode is and (Bimodal)     No mode possible.     No modal possible.       Discrete Series   Most frequent observation is appeared times. Hence, .   Most frequent observation is and both appeared times. Hence, and     Continuous Series   Exclusive class series:   L = lower limit of modal class, frequency of modal class, frequency of pre-modal class, frequency of post-modal class, class interval.  Modal class is the highest frequency class data. In the given series, is the modal class.    Inclusive class series  convert the inclusive class into exclusive class. now modal class =   therefore,    Properties of mode    It is the most frequent value.    Series can have unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, or no modal.    It is the most unstable average.    It is not based on all observations.    It is not affected by extreme values.        Relation between Mean, Median, and Mode:   Perfectly symmetric distribution  here calculated, .     In perfectly symmetric distribution, mean, median, and mode are coinsident on one another. That is,    Positively skewed distribution  here calculated, , and Hence, in perfectly symmetric distribution,      In positively skewed distribution, In skewed distribution, median always comes between mean and mode and follow the following relation.    Negatively skewed distribution  here calculated, , and .     In negatively skewed distribution, In skewed distribution, median always comes between mean and mode and follow the following relation.     Geometric Mean (GM)   Individual Series:  Make a table as shown below:     Discrete Series:      Continuous Series:       Harmonic Mean (HM)   Individual Series:  Make a table as shown below:     Discrete Series:      Continuous Series:        Dispersion   It is a measure of the extent to which the observations vary from some central value (mean, median, mode). It shows how the data are spread out (dispersed) from the central value. In simple terms, it shows how squeezed or scattered the variable is. For example: the mean of is Here, the dispersion shows how far are the observations from the mean (central value). The difference in each data point from the central value is represents deviation of the data.  Suppose I have the three data set as shown below: The data shows the difference in and . the observations in series A does not vary at all from the central value (mean), there is some variation in series B, but no observations are even close to the mean in series C.    Measurement of Dispersion  Dispersion can be measured using two different approaches.     Absolute Measure (same unit)  Absolute measures of dispersion use the original units of data, and are most useful on understanding the dispersion within the context of your experiment and measurements.   Range    Quartile Deviation    Mean Deviation    Standard Deviation    Variance       Relative Measure (unit free)  In order to compare separate data sets or different experiments that might use different units and the difference in their central values are very high, we use relative measures.   Coefficient of Range    Coefficient of Quartile Deviation    Coefficient of Mean Deviation    Coefficient of Standard Deviation    Coefficient of Variance       Note: Low dispersion means more stable observations.    Range   Range is the difference between the highest and the lowest value of observations for a given frequency distribution. The coefficient of range on the other hand is the ratio of difference between the highest and lowest value of observations to the sum of highest and lowest value of observations.      Here, largest observation, and smallest observation.    Individual Series                              Discrete Series                              Continuous Series     Exclusive Series         Inclusive Series     First convert the inclusive series into exclusive one.          Merits of Range:     Among all the methods of studying dispersion range is the simplest to understand and easiest to compare.    Range is quickest measure of dispersion.       Limits of Range:     Range is not based on each and every observation of series.    It is most affected by sampling fluctuations.    Range is most unreliable as a guide of the dispersion.    Range cannot be calculated for the open-end classification.       Uses of Range     Quality control    Fluctuations in the share prices    Weather forecast    Everyday life observations        Quartile Deviation      Quartile deviation is a statistic that measures the deviation in the middle of the data. Quartile deviation is also referred to as the semi interquartile range and is half of the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile value. Quartiles divide a group of observations into four equal parts. The first quartile, denoted by is defined as the percentile, the second quartile ( ) is defined as the percentile (median), and the third quartile ( ) is defined as the percentile.  The formula for quartile deviation of the data is   The coefficient of quartile deviation is a measure of dispersion, which is used to describe the spread or distribution of data.  Coefficient of quartile deviation, Here, is first quartile (or, lower quartile),  is second quartile (or, median), and is third quartile (or, upper quartile) Where represents the total number of observations in the given data set.    Individual series   arrange in order Here , which is median, is first quartile, and is third quartile.    Find the quartiles and quartile deviation of the following data:     First arrange the data into order Number of data values = .  Median of the even number data set using ,   Now, lower half of the data is: (even number of observations)    Also, the upper half of the data is: (even number of observations)    Therefore the Quartile deviation, using equation .  and the coefficient of Quartile deviation using ,       Discrete series   Arrange the table into asscending or discending order   For first quartile,     For third quartile,     Hence,       Find Cumulative frequency             Hence,        Continuous series  Quartile Deviation for Grouped Data:    the quartile,   the lower limit of the quartile class,   class interval,   the frequency of the quartile class,   the cumulative frequency of the class preceding the quartile class,   Number of observations in the given data set.   <Exclusive series:>    Class selection for , modal Class for     using equation   Class selection for , modal Class for     using equation   Hence,     <Inclusive series:>  Convert this series into exclusive one.   Class selection for , modal Class for     using equation   Class selection for , modal Class for     using equation   Hence,       Standard Deviation, and Variance,   Standard deviation tells how far a group of numbers (observation) is from the mean.  Variance is the average of the squared differences of a group of numbers (observation) from the mean.  Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is also called root mean square deviation. Standard deviation, Variance and their coefficients can be calculated using the following formulae:   Actual Mean Method    is total number of observations.    Assumed Mean Method   here, , is assumed mean, and is total number of observations..

Now from equation  here, also, using equation  and from eqn.  Also and using eqn. , we have        Mean Deviation   The mean deviation is the average deviation from the mean value of the given data set. The mean deviation of the data values can be easily calculated using the procedure below.   Step 1: Find the mean value for the given data values    Step 2: Now, subtract the mean value from each of the data values given (Note: Ignore the minus symbol)    Step 3: Now, find the mean of those values obtained in step 2.     The formula to calculate the mean deviation is given below. Here, represents each value in the data set, represents the mean of the data set, represents the number of data values, and  represents the absolute value, which ignores the “ ” symbol.    Mean deviation from mean   Step 1. Find the mean: The Mean Deviation of   Step 2. Find the distance of each value from that mean:  Step 3. Find the mean of those distances: The values are, on average, 3.75 away from the middle.     Quartiles, Deciles, Percentiles   Quartiles: there are three quartiles, called I quartile (or lower quartile), II quartile (or median), and III quartile (or upper quartile).      Deciles: there are 9 deciles:   and so on.   Percentiles: there are 99 deciles:   and so on.    Calculate the quartile, decile, and percentile of the following data:     Arrange the data in ascending order as Number of item,   Using               Example    Classify the data into four types and give unit for numerical data.
